# Minecraft-Internal-Cheat
A Minecraft injection client written in c++

Uses the jvmti to manipulate the game process in order to achieve the unachievable :D

it's far from done and has quite a lot of bugs i can't be bothered to fix, however it is operational and shows how one internal injection cheat for this game might look.

If you're looking to create a similiar project, please don't do as I did. Using jvmti is not optimal for this purpose, refer to injecting forge mods or bytecode manipulation. I used jvmti solely for the purpose of learning.
